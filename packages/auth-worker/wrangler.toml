# Environment variables (non-secret)
[vars]
# These are public - client ID can be exposed
# GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"

# For self-hosted deployments, set these secrets via `wrangler secret put`:
# - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID (or set in [vars] since it's public)
# - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET (MUST be a secret)
#
# Example:
#   wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
#   wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID

# Production environment (override for production deployment)
# [env.production]
# vars = { GITHUB_CLIENT_ID = "production_client_id" }
